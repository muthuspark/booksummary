<p>Peter Bregman’s “Leading with Emotional Courage” isn’t solely about leadership in a corporate setting; it’s a guide to navigating life’s challenges with emotional resilience and authenticity. The core argument revolves around the idea that facing our fears, acknowledging our vulnerabilities, and embracing discomfort are crucial for personal and professional growth.
