<h2 id="understanding-emotional-intelligence-in-project-management">Understanding Emotional Intelligence in Project Management</h2>
<p>Anthony Mersino’s “Emotional Intelligence for Project Managers” argues that technical skills alone are insufficient for project success. Effective project management hinges heavily on emotional intelligence (EQ), the ability to understand and manage one’s own emotions and those of others. The book provides a practical framework for cultivating EQ to enhance performance and navigate the complexities of project leadership.</p>
<h2 id="self-awareness-the-foundation-of-eq">Self-Awareness: The Foundation of EQ</h2>
<p>Self-awareness is the cornerstone of emotional intelligence. Mersino stresses the importance of understanding one’s own strengths, weaknesses, values, and emotional triggers. This involves honest self-reflection and a willingness to seek feedback from others. He emphasizes the need for project managers to recognize their emotional state and how it impacts their interactions and decision-making. Ignoring one’s emotions can lead to poor judgment and strained relationships within the project team.</p>
