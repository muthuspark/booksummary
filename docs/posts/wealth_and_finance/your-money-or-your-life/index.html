<h3 id="the-importance-of-mindful-spending">The Importance of Mindful Spending</h3>
<p>The book emphasizes the critical importance of becoming fully aware of your spending habits. This isn’t simply about tracking expenses; it’s about understanding the underlying motivations behind every purchase. Why are you buying this?
