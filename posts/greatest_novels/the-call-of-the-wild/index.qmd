## The Plot: From Domesticity to the Wild

Buck, a powerful and well-cared-for dog living on a California ranch, is stolen and thrust into the harsh world of dog sledding in the Yukon Territory. Initially subjected to cruelty and mistreatment, Buck's experiences force him to survive. He learns to fight for his place in the harsh hierarchy of the dog teams, employing both strength and cunning. He endures brutal conditions, including starvation, exhaustion, and violence, demonstrating a remarkable capacity for resilience. His journey takes him through various masters, each shaping his character in distinct ways.
