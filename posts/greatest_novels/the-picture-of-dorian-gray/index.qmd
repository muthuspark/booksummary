# The Picture of Dorian Gray: A Summary and Analysis

Oscar Wilde's *The Picture of Dorian Gray* is a gothic novel exploring the seductive nature of beauty, the corrupting influence of desire, and the consequences of unchecked hedonism.  The story revolves around Dorian Gray, a strikingly beautiful young man whose portrait ages and deteriorates while he remains eternally youthful, bearing the burden of his sins.  This Faustian bargain sets the stage for a narrative rife with aestheticism, moral decay, and ultimately, tragic consequences.


## The Plot: A Faustian Bargain and Its Repercussions

The novel begins with Basil Hallward, a renowned artist, painting a portrait of the exquisitely beautiful Dorian Gray.  Lord Henry Wotton, a cynical and influential aesthete, introduces Dorian to the idea of pursuing pleasure above all else, urging him to live a life solely dedicated to the pursuit of beauty and experience.  Dorian, captivated by Lord Henry's philosophy, makes a wish that his portrait would age instead of him, preserving his youthful beauty forever.  His wish is granted, setting in motion a chain of events that leads to his moral and spiritual ruin.

As Dorian pursues his hedonistic desires, the portrait reflects his inner corruption, becoming increasingly grotesque and horrifying, a visual manifestation of his sins.  He engages in numerous affairs, manipulates and betrays others, and commits acts of cruelty, all while maintaining his outward appearance of youthful perfection.  Basil, horrified by Dorian's moral degradation, confronts him, only to be murdered by Dorian, who then hides the body and preserves his facade of innocence.

The weight of his actions and the ever-worsening state of the portrait begin to haunt Dorian. Years pass, and he becomes increasingly isolated and tormented by the decaying image of his true self. He attempts to escape his past, traveling and indulging in further vices.  Ultimately, the accumulated guilt and his realization of the true cost of his choices lead him to destroy the portrait, which in turn results in his own death.  His body, now reflecting the years of depravity, appears aged and ravaged, instantaneously making up for the years that he had stolen from the painting.

## Character Development and Resolution

Dorian's character arc is a descent into moral depravity. Initially naive and idealistic, he is corrupted by Lord Henry's philosophy and his own vanity.  His transformation is gradual, starting with minor acts of cruelty and escalating into murder.  He shows no significant growth or remorse until the very end, when his terror at the sight of the aging portrait compels him to self-destruction.
