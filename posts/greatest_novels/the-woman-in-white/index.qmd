# The Woman in White: A Summary and Analysis

Wilkie Collins's *The Woman in White* is a Victorian sensation novel renowned for its plot, suspenseful narrative, and exploration of social injustice and deception. The story unfolds through a series of interconnected narratives, primarily told by Walter Hartright, a drawing-master, and Marian Halcombe, a strong-willed and intelligent woman. The central focus is on Anne Catherick, a woman who eerily resembles Laura Fairlie, and the machinations of Count Fosco, a seemingly harmless but ultimately sinister character.

## The Plot: A Labyrinth of Deceit
