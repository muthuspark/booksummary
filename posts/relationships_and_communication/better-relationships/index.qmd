There is no known book titled "Better Relationships" by an author named Sarah Rozenthuler.  It's possible there's a misspelling in the author's name or the book title, or the book is self-published and not widely indexed.  Without access to the specific book's content, I cannot provide a summary.

However, I can offer a comprehensive overview of common advice, strategies, and actionable insights found in books dedicated to improving relationships, drawing from widely accepted relationship expertise. This summary will cover key areas typically addressed in such literature.

**I. Understanding Yourself and Your Needs:**

Many relationship improvement books emphasize self-awareness as the cornerstone of better connections. This involves:

* **Identifying Your Attachment Style:** Understanding whether you have a secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, or fearful-avoidant attachment style helps you recognize patterns in your relationships and address potential insecurities or anxieties.  This awareness allows for more conscious choices in how you interact and manage expectations.

* **Exploring Your Values and Needs:**  Identifying your core values and emotional needs – such as security, autonomy, intimacy, and validation – provides clarity on what you seek in a relationship and helps you communicate your needs effectively. Understanding your boundaries is crucial here, knowing what you will and won't tolerate in a relationship.

* **Addressing Past Trauma:** Unresolved past traumas significantly impact present relationships. Recognizing and addressing past hurts through therapy or self-reflection allows for healthier patterns of interaction and emotional regulation.

**II. Communication and Conflict Resolution:**

Effective communication is paramount in any successful relationship. Key strategies include:

* **Active Listening:**  Truly hearing and understanding your partner's perspective without interrupting or formulating your response. This involves paying attention to both verbal and non-verbal cues.

* **Empathy and Validation:**  Attempting to understand your partner's feelings and experiences, even if you don't agree with them. Validating their emotions doesn't mean condoning their actions but acknowledging their feelings as legitimate.

* **Non-violent Communication (NVC):** This framework emphasizes expressing needs and feelings without blame or judgment. It focuses on observations, feelings, needs, and requests, promoting constructive dialogue.

* **Conflict Resolution Techniques:** Learning healthy ways to navigate disagreements, including compromise, negotiation, and finding mutually acceptable solutions.  Avoiding escalation and personal attacks is vital.  Knowing when to take a break to cool down before resuming the conversation is also important.

**III. Building Intimacy and Connection:**

Strong relationships thrive on emotional intimacy and connection.  This includes:

* **Quality Time:**  Prioritizing dedicated time for shared activities, meaningful conversations, and simply being present together.

* **Physical Affection:**  Expressing affection through touch, hugs, and physical intimacy strengthens the bond and fosters emotional closeness.

* **Shared Activities:**  Engaging in shared hobbies, interests, and experiences creates shared memories and strengthens the bond.

* **Emotional Intimacy:**  Openly sharing your feelings, vulnerabilities, and dreams with your partner fosters trust and deepens the connection.  This requires vulnerability and a willingness to be seen authentically.

**IV. Maintaining and Nurturing the Relationship:**

Sustaining a healthy relationship requires ongoing effort and commitment. Key strategies include:

* **Regular Check-ins:**  Setting aside time to discuss the relationship's dynamics, address concerns, and reaffirm commitment.

* **Appreciation and Gratitude:**  Expressing gratitude and appreciation for your partner's contributions, both big and small, keeps the positive energy flowing.

* **Seeking Professional Help:**  Don't hesitate to seek professional guidance from a therapist or counselor if you're facing significant challenges.  This is a sign of strength, not weakness.

* **Forgiveness and Letting Go:**  Learning to forgive past hurts and letting go of resentment is crucial for moving forward. This doesn't mean condoning harmful behavior, but releasing the emotional burden it carries.


This overview provides a general framework for improving relationships. The specifics would vary depending on the book's focus and target audience.  If you can provide the correct title and author, I can offer a more precise summary if the book is accessible.
