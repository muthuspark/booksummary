# Steal Like an Artist: A Summary

Austin Kleon's "Steal Like an Artist" isn't about plagiarism. It's a manifesto for creative confidence, urging readers to influence and build upon the work of others to forge their own unique paths. The book's core message revolves around the idea that all creativity is a remix, and that understanding and applying this principle is important for artistic growth and a more fulfilling life.


##  Show Your Work

The book strongly emphasizes the importance of sharing your creative process.  Hiding your work prevents feedback, connection with others, and the potential for collaboration and growth.

```

Showing your work doesn't require perfection. It's about putting yourself out there, even if it feels vulnerable.  The act of sharing encourages engagement and helps you refine your craft through constructive criticism and unexpected opportunities.  Think blogs, social media, portfolio websites â€“ any platform that allows you to expose your work.


##  Copy What You Love

Kleon encourages active imitation as a critical learning tool.  Don't just passively admire the work of others; actively copy it.  This isn't about creating exact replicas but about understanding the underlying techniques, styles, and approaches.

```

By copying, you internalize the principles of the work you admire. Analyzing your copies helps you understand *why* something works. Eventually, you'll innovate, forging your own style while acknowledging your influences. This process fosters a deeper understanding of your own creative inclinations.


##  Write the Book You Want to Read

This applies to any creative endeavor.  If you can't find the book, the song, the art, or the design you want to consume, create it yourself. This encourages you to pursue your passions and address unfulfilled needs in your field. This process allows you to look at your personal taste and address the current market gaps.


##  Do Good Work

Quality trumps quantity. Focusing on producing excellent, meaningful work, even if it's a small amount, is more than churning out mediocre content. It's about perfecting your craft.


##  Be an Interesting Person

Creativity isn't confined to a specific field or skill. It stems from a life filled with various experiences.  Read widely, engage in conversations, and allow life's experiences to enrich your creative output.


##  Don't Wait Until You're Ready

Perfectionism often paralyzes creativity. The book urges you to start creating immediately, even if you don't feel fully prepared. The process of starting is important for learning and growth. Don't seek external validation to start your creative process, begin for yourself.


##  Understand the Business

Being creative is not enough.  You must learn to understand how your work fits into the market and how to navigate the business side of your creative endeavors. Whether it's building an audience, marketing your work, or finding collaborators, a business mindset is key to sustained creative success.


##  Stick With It

Creativity is a marathon, not a sprint.  It takes time, persistence, and resilience to develop your skills and build a sustainable creative practice. Be patient with your creative process; consistency over time beats spurts of inspiration.
