# Contagious: Why Things Catch On - A Summary

Jonah Berger's "Contagious" explores the science of virality, explaining why some ideas, products, and messages spread like wildfire while others fizzle out. The book offers practical, actionable advice for designing messages and products with contagiousness, ultimately leading to greater success in various aspects of life, from marketing and business to personal influence and social impact.

## STEPPS: The Six Principles of Contagiousness

The core of Berger's argument rests on STEPPS, a mnemonic device representing six key principles driving contagiousness. Understanding and applying these principles can increase the likelihood of your ideas or products becoming widespread.

### Social Currency: Making People Feel Good About Themselves

People share things that make them look good.  To use social currency, create content and products that are inherently shareable, allowing people to associate themselves with something desirable. This can involve generating exclusivity, creating intriguing news, and leveraging the power of inner circles.

* **Actionable Insight:**  Design your message or product to be a conversation starter, something others will want to be associated with.  Think "insider knowledge" or something unique and noteworthy.

### Triggers: Top of Mind, Top of Tongue

The more frequently people are reminded of something, the more likely they are to share it.  This involves connecting your message or product to ubiquitous cues in the environment.

* **Actionable Insight:**  Associate your ideas with common events, holidays, or everyday occurrences to increase top-of-mind awareness and spontaneous sharing.

### Emotion: When We Care, We Share

Highly emotional content, whether positive or negative, is more likely to be shared.  This is because strong emotions drive people to share and connect.

* **Actionable Insight:**  Evoke strong emotions – awe, amusement, anger, anxiety – in your communication.  Ensure your message is genuinely emotionally resonant.  Avoid using overly manipulative tactics.

### Public: Observable, Imitable

People tend to copy what others are doing. If a product or idea is publicly visible and easily imitable, it's more likely to spread.

* **Actionable Insight:**  Design your product or message to be visible and easily demonstrable, making imitation easy and desirable.

### Practical Value: News You Can Use

People share things that are useful to others. Providing practical advice, helpful information, or solving a problem increases shareability.

* **Actionable Insight:**  Focus on the value your product or message provides to the recipient.  Clearly communicate the benefits and usefulness to encourage sharing.

### Stories: Information Wrapped in Entertainment

People share stories, not just facts.  Stories make information memorable and emotionally engaging.  They often transport the listener or reader.

* **Actionable Insight:**  Frame your message as a narrative, focusing on an engaging plot that captures the audience's attention and delivers a memorable experience.  Use unexpected plot twists for better recall.



## Beyond STEPPS: Additional Strategies for Contagiousness


While STEPPS forms the bedrock of Berger's framework, the book delves deeper into specific strategies that can make ideas and products more contagious.


### Leveraging the Power of Social Influence

Social proof, the tendency to conform to the actions of others, is a potent driver of behaviour. Highlighting social proof (e.g., testimonials, reviews, popularity indicators) can increase adoption rates.

* **Actionable Insight:**  Use social proof effectively by showcasing positive user reviews, testimonials, or popularity metrics prominently.

###  Harnessing the Power of Groups and Communities

Building communities around your product or idea can increase its reach and impact. Active engagement and fostering a sense of belonging within a community can encourage sharing and loyalty.

* **Actionable Insight:**  Create online forums, social media groups, or other platforms that allow users to connect, share, and build a sense of community around your product or idea.

###  Understanding the Role of Context

The environment in which a product or idea is presented plays a role in its contagiousness. The timing, location, and overall context are all important factors.

* **Actionable Insight:**  Be mindful of the context in which your message is shared.  Tailor your message to the specific audience and their environment to increase relevance and receptivity.


## Applying Contagiousness in Different Aspects of Life


Berger's work is not limited to marketing; it extends to various aspects of life.

* **Personal Branding:** Craft a personal narrative that is engaging and shareable, highlighting your unique value proposition.
* **Social Change:** Design campaigns that use emotional triggers, social currency, and practical value to inspire action and mobilize communities.
* **Building Relationships:**  Share things that are meaningful and engaging, fostering emotional connections and shared experiences.
* **Improving productivity:**  Make your work more memorable and engaging to increase the likelihood of collaboration and positive feedback


## The Power of Strategic Contagiousness

"Contagious" provides a framework for understanding and leveraging the principles of virality. By strategically applying the STEPPS principles and the various strategies discussed, individuals and organizations can increase the reach and impact of their ideas, products, and messages, resulting in greater personal and professional success. Ultimately, the book empowers readers to design messages and create products that resonate, leading to meaningful growth and influence. The actionable advice offered is about building lasting value and impact. The power of understanding and applying contagiousness lies in its ability to create genuine connection and influence.
