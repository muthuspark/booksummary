Michael Watkins' "The First 90 Days" offers a practical, evidence-based framework for succeeding in new leadership roles.  It transcends the simplistic "hit the ground running" mentality, advocating a structured approach to learning, building relationships, and achieving early wins within the crucial first three months of a new job.  The book focuses on adapting this framework to various scenarios, whether it's a promotion within the same organization, a move to a new company, or even a significant career transition.

The core message revolves around the idea that the first 90 days aren't just about proving oneself; they're about learning the lay of the land and strategically positioning oneself for long-term success.  Watkins emphasizes that this period is a critical window of opportunity, one that if mishandled, can significantly hinder future performance.

The book is divided into three phases, mirroring the 90-day period:

**Phase 1: Learning and Assessment (Days 1-30):** This initial stage prioritizes understanding the new environment and building a solid foundation for future action.  Watkins argues against jumping into immediate changes; instead, he advocates for a deliberate learning process.  Key strategies within this phase include:

* **Accelerated Learning:** This isn't simply passive observation.  It involves actively seeking out information through diverse channels â€“ from formal presentations and documents to informal conversations with colleagues, clients, and competitors.  Watkins highlights the importance of questioning assumptions and seeking out diverse perspectives to build a comprehensive understanding.

* **Building Relationships:** This is arguably the most critical aspect of Phase 1.  It goes beyond simply meeting people; it's about identifying key players, understanding their agendas, and building genuine rapport.  The author emphasizes the power of active listening and demonstrating genuine interest in others' perspectives.  Building a network of trusted advisors is crucial for navigating the complexities of the new role.

* **Establishing Credibility:**  This doesn't involve making grand pronouncements but demonstrating competence, integrity, and a genuine commitment to learning.  Actions speak louder than words; consistently displaying a strong work ethic and seeking to understand the organization's culture build trust and respect.

* **Diagnosing the Situation:** This requires a critical and objective assessment of the team, the organization's strengths and weaknesses, and the current challenges.  Watkins stresses the importance of going beyond surface-level observations to understand the underlying dynamics and unspoken issues.

**Phase 2: Matching Strategy and Execution (Days 31-60):**  Once a solid foundation is laid, Phase 2 focuses on developing and executing a short-term strategy aligned with the organization's goals and the leader's personal objectives.  This involves:

* **Developing a 90-Day Plan:**  This isn't a rigid document but a flexible roadmap outlining key priorities, objectives, and milestones.  It should be realistic and achievable, focusing on tangible results that demonstrate early success.

* **Building a Coalition:**  Phase 2 requires leveraging the relationships built in Phase 1 to gather support for the 90-day plan. This involves engaging key stakeholders, securing buy-in for proposed initiatives, and addressing potential concerns proactively.  This stage highlights the importance of skillful negotiation and consensus-building.

* **Early Wins:**  Achieving visible and impactful results within the first 60 days is crucial for building momentum and demonstrating leadership capabilities.  These wins should be strategically chosen, focusing on initiatives that are both impactful and feasible within the timeframe.  They should also ideally align with the longer-term goals of the organization.

* **Managing Expectations:**  Communicating the 90-day plan and its anticipated outcomes to relevant stakeholders is essential for managing expectations and preventing misunderstandings.  Regular updates and transparent communication build trust and maintain momentum.

**Phase 3: Building for Long-Term Success (Days 61-90):** This final phase involves solidifying the gains from the previous two phases and setting the stage for long-term success.  Key elements include:

* **Solidifying the Team:**  Based on the assessment conducted in Phase 1, this involves making key personnel decisions, building a high-performing team, and delegating effectively.  It's about creating a culture of collaboration and accountability.

* **Establishing Long-Term Goals:**  The 90-day plan serves as a stepping stone towards developing a longer-term vision and strategy aligned with the organization's overall objectives.  This involves setting ambitious yet achievable goals and outlining the roadmap for achieving them.

* **Seeking Feedback:**  Actively soliciting feedback from colleagues, subordinates, and superiors is crucial for identifying areas for improvement and ensuring ongoing development.  This continuous feedback loop ensures the leader remains adaptable and responsive to the changing dynamics of the environment.

* **Refining the Approach:**  Based on the experience of the first 90 days, the leader should refine their approach and adapt their strategy to optimize future performance.  This is an iterative process that emphasizes continuous learning and improvement.


Watkins' advice extends beyond specific techniques; it emphasizes a mindset of proactive learning, strategic planning, and relationship building.  The book acknowledges the challenges involved in transitioning into a new role, highlighting the importance of self-awareness, resilience, and adaptability.  It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but a flexible framework that can be adapted to various circumstances and personal styles.  The key takeaway is that success in a new role isn't simply a matter of luck or innate talent; it's a strategic process that requires careful planning, consistent effort, and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement. By embracing the structured approach outlined in "The First 90 Days," readers can significantly enhance their chances of not only surviving but thriving in their new roles and achieving lasting success.
