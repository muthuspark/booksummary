# Mating: A Summary and Analysis

Norman Rush's "Mating" is a complex and richly layered novel exploring the intricate dynamics of love, politics, anthropology, and personal transformation against the backdrop of a fictional African nation.  The story unfolds primarily through the eyes of Nelson Denoon, a recently widowed anthropologist, and his evolving relationship with his much younger wife, Nell.  Their romance and subsequent marriage serve as a microcosm reflecting the larger complexities of cultural interaction, societal pressures, and the inherent challenges in forging authentic connections.


## The Plot and Primary Characters

The novel's plot revolves around Nelson's fieldwork in Kalahari, where he encounters Nell, a vibrant and idealistic young woman volunteering with a controversial development project.  Their relationship blossoms amidst the stark beauty and harsh realities of the African landscape, culminating in a whirlwind courtship and marriage.  Their union, however, is far from simple.  Nell’s radical ideas and unwavering commitment to her vision of transforming Kalahari clash with Nelson’s more cautious and pragmatic approach to life and research.  This forms the central conflict of the narrative.

Nelson, a seasoned anthropologist, is a man deeply invested in his academic pursuits and grappling with the recent loss of his wife. His initial attraction to Nell is rooted in her youthful energy and contrasting worldview, offering him a chance for rejuvenation and a new perspective on life.  However, as their relationship develops, he finds himself increasingly challenged by her unwavering idealism and confrontational nature. His motivations are primarily driven by a desire for emotional healing, a sense of intellectual stimulation, and a yearning for a connection that transcends the mundane.

Nell, on the other hand, represents a generation of passionate idealists convinced they can shape the world according to their progressive values.  Her unwavering commitment to the Kalahari project, driven by a belief in empowering the local population and implementing radical social change, fuels her interactions with Nelson and ultimately dictates the trajectory of their lives together.  Her motivations are deeply rooted in her altruistic desires, her inherent need to make a difference, and her youthful belief in the transformative power of social action.

The other characters, including the individuals involved in the Kalahari project, add layers of complexity to the narrative, highlighting diverse perspectives on development, cultural preservation, and the potential pitfalls of well-intentioned intervention.  These characters provide a foil against which Nelson and Nell's relationship unfolds, highlighting the ethical dilemmas inherent in the pursuit of social change and the challenges of cross-cultural understanding.


## Key Themes and Central Conflict

Several key themes intertwine throughout the novel.  The most prominent include:

* **Cultural Interaction and Misunderstanding:** The novel explores the complexities of cross-cultural interactions, highlighting the potential for both positive exchange and profound misunderstanding.  The differing perspectives of Nelson, Nell, and the Kalahari people illustrate the challenges of bridging cultural divides and the importance of empathy and cultural sensitivity.

* **Idealism vs. Pragmatism:** The central conflict of the novel stems from the clash between Nell's passionate idealism and Nelson's more cautious pragmatism.  This conflict underscores the tensions between the desire for radical change and the practical limitations of implementing such change.

* **Love, Marriage, and Personal Transformation:** The evolving relationship between Nelson and Nell serves as a powerful vehicle for exploring the nature of love, marriage, and the potential for personal growth through intimate connection.  Their journey together highlights the challenges of navigating diverse personalities, conflicting values, and the complexities of long-term commitment.

* **The Ethics of Development and Intervention:** The novel raises critical questions about the ethics of development interventions, particularly in the context of cultural preservation and empowering marginalized communities.  The Kalahari project serves as a case study, prompting reflection on the potential benefits and drawbacks of external involvement in local affairs.


## Character Development and Resolution

Both Nelson and Nell undergo significant transformations throughout the novel.  Nelson, initially hesitant and somewhat cynical, gradually embraces Nell's idealism, though he retains his pragmatic approach.  He learns to appreciate the importance of action and the power of transformative engagement, while also acknowledging the limits of his own knowledge and the need for humility.  His character development highlights the capacity for growth and change, even in later life.

Nell, despite her unwavering convictions, confronts the complexities of implementing her vision.  Her initial enthusiasm is tempered by the realities of working within a challenging environment, dealing with political intrigue, and grappling with the limitations of her own power.  Her journey demonstrates the importance of adapting to unforeseen circumstances while remaining true to one's core values.  Both characters learn to compromise, to listen, and to respect the diverse perspectives that surround them.

The ultimate resolution is not a neat conclusion but rather a reflection of the ongoing nature of their relationship and their commitment to the challenges ahead. They reconcile their differences to a degree, finding a way to navigate their complexities and continue to learn and grow together.  The open-ended nature of the ending emphasizes the importance of ongoing dialogue and adaptation in relationships and in addressing complex social issues.
