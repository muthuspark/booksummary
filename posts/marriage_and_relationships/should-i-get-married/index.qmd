## Understanding Yourself Before Marriage

M. Blaine Smith's "Should I Get Married?" isn't a simple yes or no guide.  Instead, it's a deeply introspective journey designed to help readers assess their readiness for marriage.  The book emphasizes self-awareness as the foundational element of a successful marital union. Before even considering marriage, Smith urges readers to thoroughly examine their motivations, values, and emotional maturity.  He challenges the reader to identify their personal strengths and weaknesses, understanding how those traits might impact a relationship.  This self-assessment isn't just about identifying flaws; it's about fostering self-acceptance and understanding how to contribute positively to a partnership.


## Defining Your Needs and Expectations

A key aspect of Smith's advice lies in clearly defining personal needs and expectations within a marriage. He stresses the importance of recognizing individual desires and ensuring they align, at least to a significant degree, with a potential partner's. This involves honest self-reflection about lifestyle preferences, financial goals, career aspirations, and desired family dynamics. Unrealistic expectations, fueled by societal pressures or romanticized notions of marriage, are identified as major pitfalls. Smith encourages a pragmatic approach, urging readers to temper idealized visions with a realistic understanding of the compromises and challenges in any long-term relationship. Open communication and a willingness to negotiate are presented as essential tools for managing differing expectations.


## Identifying Relationship Red Flags

Smith dedicates a significant portion of the book to recognizing potential red flags in a romantic relationship. He outlines various warning signs that may indicate incompatibility or underlying issues, including controlling behavior, consistent disrespect, a lack of emotional availability, financial irresponsibility, and a history of problematic relationships. He emphasizes the importance of not overlooking these early warning signals, urging readers to trust their instincts and prioritize their well-being. Ignoring red flags, often driven by a desire for the relationship to work, can lead to significant problems later. Smith stresses the importance of seeking external advice from trusted friends and family who can offer unbiased insights.

## Understanding Communication and Conflict Resolution

Effective communication is presented as the cornerstone of a healthy marriage.  Smith provides practical strategies for improving communication skills, emphasizing active listening, clear expression of needs and feelings, and the importance of empathy.  He doesn't shy away from the inevitable conflicts that arise in any relationship. Instead, he equips readers with tools for navigating disagreements constructively.  This involves learning to identify the root causes of conflict, expressing anger and frustration healthily, and finding mutually acceptable solutions.  He stresses the importance of avoiding personal attacks and focusing on resolving the issue at hand rather than winning an argument.


## Evaluating Compatibility and Shared Values

Beyond individual readiness, Smith highlights the element of compatibility. He emphasizes the importance of shared values, goals, and beliefs as the foundation for a lasting union. This extends beyond superficial similarities to deeper principles regarding family, faith, finances, and life's purpose. He encourages readers to assess areas of potential conflict and to consider the extent to which differing viewpoints can be reconciled. A clear understanding of each partner's worldview and long-term aspirations is essential for building a mutually supportive and fulfilling partnership.


## The Importance of Financial Stability and Planning

Financial matters are another critical area addressed in the book. Smith stresses the importance of financial transparency and open communication about money management styles, debt levels, and future financial goals. He emphasizes the need for a shared understanding of financial responsibilities and a joint approach to financial planning.  He acknowledges that differing financial philosophies can be a significant source of conflict and suggests premarital financial counseling to address potential disagreements and establish a solid financial foundation for the marriage.


## Considering the Role of Family and Friends

The influence of family and friends on a marriage is also examined. Smith advises readers to consider the dynamics of their families and how they might impact the relationship.  He encourages open communication with family members and establishes clear boundaries to protect the marriage from undue external pressures.  The support and acceptance of close friends and family can be invaluable, but equally, negative influences must be identified and mitigated.


## Preparing for the Challenges of Marriage

Smith doesn't paint an unrealistic picture of marriage. He acknowledges the inevitable challenges and stresses in any long-term commitment. He prepares readers for the possibility of difficult periods, such as job loss, illness, or financial hardship. He emphasizes the importance of resilience, adaptability, and a commitment to working through difficulties together. This involves developing strong coping mechanisms and seeking support from therapists or other professionals when needed.


## The Role of Professional Guidance

Throughout the book, Smith emphasizes the value of seeking professional help when needed. He recommends premarital counseling as a tool for couples to look at their compatibility, communication styles, and expectations before making a lifelong commitment. He also emphasizes the importance of seeking professional guidance during times of marital conflict or crisis. This proactive approach can help couples address challenges effectively and prevent small issues from escalating into significant problems.


## Conclusion: A Journey of Self-Discovery and Informed Decision-Making

"Should I Get Married?" isn't a simple checklist for determining marital readiness.  It's a detailed guide designed to help individuals embark on a journey of self-discovery, enabling them to make an informed decision about marriage based on a thorough understanding of themselves, their potential partner, and the complexities of marital life.  The book's strength lies in its emphasis on self-awareness, realistic expectations, effective communication, and proactive problem-solving. By fostering a deeper understanding of these elements, Smith empowers readers to create a fulfilling and lasting marriage, or to make the equally valid choice of remaining single with greater self-understanding. The book's value extends beyond the decision of whether or not to marry; it provides  into personal growth and building healthy relationships throughout life.
