Edmund Morris's "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" is not merely a biography; it's a deep dive into the complex personality and tumultuous life of one of America's most charismatic and influential presidents.  The book meticulously traces Roosevelt's journey from a sickly, privileged youth to the "bully pulpit" of the presidency, showcasing his relentless drive, unwavering ambition, and profound impact on American politics and society.  Morris masterfully weaves together meticulously researched historical details with insightful psychological analysis, offering a multifaceted portrait of a man defined by both extraordinary accomplishments and significant flaws.

Roosevelt's early life laid the foundation for the man he would become. Born into a wealthy New York family, he was frail and asthmatic as a child, a condition that fueled his determination to overcome physical limitations. This early struggle instilled in him a fierce will to succeed and a relentless pursuit of self-improvement. His father, Theodore Sr., instilled in him a strong moral compass and a sense of civic duty, while his mother's early death profoundly impacted his emotional development.  Morris highlights the profound influence of these early experiences on shaping Roosevelt's character, emphasizing his drive to compensate for his perceived weaknesses through strenuous physical activity and intellectual pursuits.

His education, encompassing Harvard University and further self-education, broadened his intellectual horizons and cemented his commitment to public service.  Harvard provided him with the intellectual framework for understanding history, politics, and the natural world, while his insatiable curiosity led him to pursue self-directed study, devouring books and engaging in rigorous physical training to build his strength and stamina.  This self-driven learning, combined with his formal education, solidified his understanding of American history and shaped his political philosophy, providing the foundation for his later political career.

Roosevelt's career progressed rapidly, initially in New York state politics. He began as a New York Assemblyman, demonstrating an early aptitude for politics and a commitment to progressive reform. This early political experience provided him with invaluable skills in navigating the complexities of the political landscape and forging alliances. Morris portrays this period as crucial in establishing Roosevelt's reputation as a reformer, someone committed to tackling corruption and advocating for the rights of the common man. His service as the Police Commissioner of New York City further honed his administrative skills and reinforced his commitment to efficiency and combating corruption, demonstrating his ability to deal with complex urban issues.

His subsequent role as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Harrison proved pivotal in launching him onto the national stage. Though a relatively minor position, Roosevelt used his position to advocate for a stronger navy and an assertive foreign policy, preparing him for the challenges of future leadership roles. His fervent nationalism and belief in American exceptionalism are clearly depicted by Morris, highlighting the early seeds of the assertive foreign policy he would later champion as president.

The Spanish-American War marked a turning point in Roosevelt's life.  He resigned from his post to lead the Rough Riders, a volunteer cavalry regiment, displaying both his courage and his ambition.  This act of daring propelled him into the national spotlight, transforming him from a relatively unknown politician into a celebrated war hero. Morris effectively illustrates the strategic use of this moment to catapult his political career, highlighting the careful calculation behind the seemingly impulsive act.

His governorship of New York proved to be a testing ground for his leadership skills.  He faced resistance from powerful political bosses and navigated complex policy challenges.  His time as governor, while relatively short, demonstrated his ability to work effectively within the political system while pushing for progressive reforms. This period is portrayed by Morris as showcasing Roosevelt’s growing political acumen and his ability to successfully manage the complexities of state politics, including his ability to reconcile competing factions and forge consensus.

The Vice Presidency under William McKinley was initially seen as a political stepping stone, a somewhat underwhelming position, but fate intervened. McKinley's assassination catapulted Roosevelt to the presidency at the age of 42, making him the youngest president in American history. This unexpected ascension to the highest office initiated a period of profound change and remarkable achievement, underlining the unpredictability of fate and the importance of seizing opportunities.

As president, Roosevelt transformed the American political landscape.  His "Square Deal" program embodied his commitment to fairness and social justice, aiming to balance the interests of labor, capital, and the public.  His conservation efforts, including the establishment of national parks and forests, left an enduring legacy on environmental protection.  He aggressively pursued antitrust legislation to curb corporate power, demonstrating a commitment to regulating monopolies and promoting competition.  His foreign policy, characterized by the "Big Stick" diplomacy, was assertive and interventionist, expanding American influence globally.  Morris masterfully chronicles these impactful initiatives, illustrating how Roosevelt's energy, charisma, and vision profoundly shaped American policies and domestic and international affairs.

However, Roosevelt's presidency was not without controversy. His interventions in labor disputes, though intended to be fair, were sometimes criticized for being overly interventionist.  His expansionist foreign policy drew criticism from some quarters, and his personality, often described as domineering and impulsive, occasionally alienated political allies.  Morris does not shy away from portraying these controversies, providing a balanced perspective that acknowledges both his accomplishments and his shortcomings.  He effectively highlights the complexities of Roosevelt's character and his leadership style, acknowledging the moral ambiguities that accompanied his ambitious reforms and decisive actions.

Roosevelt's legacy remains profound and multifaceted.  He expanded the role of the presidency, establishing a precedent for active executive leadership.  His progressive reforms significantly impacted American society, leaving a lasting mark on labor relations, environmental protection, and the regulation of big business.  His assertive foreign policy significantly reshaped American global influence.  Morris ultimately presents Roosevelt as a complex, contradictory figure—a brilliant strategist, a passionate reformer, a charismatic leader, yet also a man driven by ambition, prone to impulsive action, and sometimes insensitive to the nuances of human relationships.  He leaves the reader with a nuanced understanding of a president who, despite his flaws, profoundly shaped the course of American history. The book ultimately achieves its purpose: presenting a thorough, engaging and insightful portrayal of Theodore Roosevelt’s rise to power, laying a strong foundation for understanding the totality of his life and presidency.
