Simon Schama's "Rembrandt's Eyes" is not a traditional biography in the chronological sense; it's a deeply immersive exploration of Rembrandt van Rijn's life and art, interwoven with the cultural and social fabric of 17th-century Holland. Schama doesn't simply recount the facts of Rembrandt's life; he uses Rembrandt's art as a lens through which to understand the artist's complex personality, his turbulent times, and the profound impact he had on the history of painting.  The book is less about a linear timeline and more about a thematic exploration of Rembrandt's genius and humanity.

The book begins not with Rembrandt's birth, but with a powerful image – Rembrandt's self-portrait in old age, etched with the weight of life's experiences.  This immediately sets the tone: the narrative is driven by the emotional depth and psychological complexity revealed in Rembrandt's paintings.  Schama uses this approach to illuminate Rembrandt's life, skillfully weaving together biographical details with meticulous art analysis, historical context, and evocative prose.

Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn was born in Leiden in 1606, the son of a miller. His early life, though sparsely documented, is depicted through the lens of his early works, hinting at a precocious talent and a keen eye for capturing the textures and subtleties of the everyday world. Schama suggests that Rembrandt's early immersion in the humanist tradition of Leiden, with its emphasis on classical learning and the observation of nature, profoundly shaped his artistic sensibilities. His apprenticeship with Jacob van Swanenburg, a history painter, and later with Pieter Lastman, a specialist in biblical and mythological scenes, provided him with technical skills and exposure to diverse styles. However, Rembrandt's originality quickly surpassed his teachers, demonstrating a restless spirit and a desire to forge his own path.

His move to Amsterdam in the 1630s marks a crucial turning point.  The vibrant, ambitious city, a global hub of trade and commerce, provided fertile ground for Rembrandt's artistic growth. His portraits of Amsterdam's elite, the merchants, lawyers, and scholars, showcase his remarkable ability to capture not just the physical likeness of his subjects but also their inner lives, their ambitions, and their vulnerabilities.  This mastery of portraiture, evident in works like "The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp" and numerous self-portraits, established his reputation as a leading artist. Schama masterfully details how Rembrandt's portraits became profound psychological studies, capturing the nuances of human emotion with unprecedented realism.

The book extensively explores Rembrandt's personal life, focusing on his complex relationship with Saskia van Uylenburgh, his first wife. Their marriage, marked by passionate love and devastating loss (Saskia died young), profoundly impacted his art.  Their portraits, often intimate and intensely personal, reflect the joy, sorrow, and spiritual depth of their union. The loss of Saskia, coupled with the deaths of several of his children, deeply affected Rembrandt.  Schama argues that this profound grief is reflected in the somber intensity of many of his later works, especially his self-portraits, which often depict him as a solitary figure grappling with mortality.

Rembrandt's later life was marked by financial troubles and artistic experimentation. His bold departure from the polished style favored by the elite, his embrace of a darker, more expressive palette, and his willingness to paint genre scenes and biblical narratives with unprecedented psychological depth alienated some patrons. Schama deftly traces the evolution of his style, from the dramatic chiaroscuro of his middle period to the more intimate and emotionally resonant works of his later years.  His focus shifted from grand, commissioned works to smaller, more introspective paintings.  He continued to explore the human condition, depicting both the grandeur and the fragility of human existence.

The book also tackles the controversy surrounding Rembrandt's reputation.  His unconventional style, his financial difficulties, and his unconventional personal life led to a decline in his popularity during his lifetime. Schama examines the shifting critical reception of Rembrandt's work, analyzing the factors that contributed to his relative neglect after his death and the eventual rediscovery of his genius in later centuries.

One of the central themes of Schama's book is Rembrandt's unique relationship with light. Schama argues that Rembrandt's mastery of light was not merely a technical skill; it was a profound exploration of the spiritual and emotional dimensions of human experience.  He demonstrates how Rembrandt used light to create a sense of depth, drama, and psychological intensity in his paintings. The interplay of light and shadow in his works becomes a metaphor for the uncertainties and complexities of human life.

"Rembrandt's Eyes" is ultimately a compelling exploration of the artist's life and work that transcends simple biography. Schama's writing is both scholarly and evocative, combining meticulous art historical analysis with vivid storytelling. He successfully integrates Rembrandt's life and times with his artistic achievements, offering a rich tapestry of historical, social, and psychological insights. The book doesn't shy away from portraying Rembrandt's flaws and complexities, presenting him as a deeply human figure, capable of both great artistic brilliance and profound personal struggles.  The book's lasting impact lies in its ability to illuminate Rembrandt's genius not as an isolated phenomenon but as a product of his time, his personal journey, and his relentless exploration of the human spirit.  Through Rembrandt’s eyes, Schama reveals not only the world of 17th-century Holland but also the enduring power of art to transcend time and connect with us on a deeply human level.
