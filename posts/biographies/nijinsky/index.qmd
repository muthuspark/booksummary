Richard Buckle’s biography, "Nijinsky," offers a meticulously researched and richly detailed account of the life and career of Vaslav Nijinsky, arguably the greatest male dancer of the 20th century.  Buckle’s work delves deep into Nijinsky's multifaceted persona, exploring his artistic genius, his tempestuous personal life, and his tragic descent into mental illness.  The book transcends a simple chronological narrative, instead offering a nuanced portrait of a complex individual whose life was as dramatic and captivating as his performances.

Nijinsky's early years, vividly depicted by Buckle, were characterized by poverty and hardship. Born in Kyiv in 1889 to Polish parents, he grew up in a family where dance was a necessity as much as a passion. His father, a stagehand and sometime dancer, instilled in Vaslav a rigorous discipline and an innate understanding of movement from a young age.  His formal training began at the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, a highly demanding institution known for its rigorous regimen and emphasis on classical technique.  Buckle highlights the young Nijinsky's extraordinary talent, his almost preternatural ability to absorb and execute complex steps, his unparalleled flexibility, and, most importantly, his breathtaking artistry.  He was not just technically proficient; he possessed a unique expressive power that transcended the purely physical.  His youthful performances already hinted at the revolutionary style he would later develop.

The book underscores the pivotal role Sergei Diaghilev played in Nijinsky's life and career. Diaghilev, the visionary impresario of the Ballets Russes, recognized Nijinsky's exceptional potential and nurtured his talent, shaping his artistic trajectory and propelling him to international fame. Their relationship, meticulously examined by Buckle, was initially a purely professional one, with Diaghilev serving as Nijinsky's mentor and promoter. However, it quickly evolved into a complex and passionate personal relationship, a significant aspect of Nijinsky's life that has been both celebrated and debated throughout history.

Buckle meticulously documents Nijinsky’s rise to stardom within the Ballets Russes.  The company's debut in Paris in 1909 was a sensation, and Nijinsky, with his unique style – a blend of powerful athleticism and poignant expressiveness – instantly captivated audiences. He was not just a dancer; he was a magnetic presence, possessing a rare combination of technical brilliance and dramatic intensity. Buckle highlights iconic roles like the Faun in "L'après-midi d'un faune," a role that epitomized Nijinsky's revolutionary approach to movement and interpretation, challenging established conventions and pushing the boundaries of ballet.  He broke with traditional, stylized movements, incorporating naturalism and an unprecedented level of psychological depth into his performances.  The book effectively conveys the impact of this stylistic innovation on the future of ballet,  marking a distinct shift away from purely technical virtuosity towards a more expressive and individualistic form of dance.

Beyond the Faun, Nijinsky's contributions to ballet were extensive. His choreography, though limited by the brevity of his creative peak, showcased his visionary genius.  Pieces like "Le Sacre du printemps" (The Rite of Spring) in 1913, a collaboration with Igor Stravinsky, became legendary for their revolutionary nature, shocking audiences with their unconventional music, choreography, and primal energy.  This collaboration, detailed by Buckle, exemplifies Nijinsky's innovative spirit and his willingness to push artistic boundaries.  The scandalous premiere of "Le Sacre du printemps" – with its controversial choreography and music causing uproar in the audience – stands as a testament to Nijinsky's audacious vision and his profound impact on the world of art.

However, Nijinsky's life was not devoid of challenges and controversies.  His complex relationship with Diaghilev, fraught with passion, dependence, and ultimately, heartbreak, is thoroughly explored by Buckle. Their romantic involvement, while shrouded in some mystery, profoundly influenced Nijinsky's personal and artistic life.  The unraveling of their relationship contributed to the increasing instability in Nijinsky's mental state.

Furthermore, Buckle doesn't shy away from the devastating mental illness that ultimately claimed Nijinsky. His schizophrenia, manifesting itself in increasingly erratic behavior, paranoia, and delusions, marked a tragic end to his brilliant career. The later years of his life, chronicled by Buckle, are a poignant narrative of decline and suffering.  His confinement to various sanatoriums, his struggles with his condition, and the unwavering devotion of his wife, Romola Nijinsky, paint a heartbreaking picture of a man grappling with a debilitating disease while his extraordinary talent lay dormant.

Buckle's biography is not just a record of Nijinsky's triumphs and failures; it's a penetrating study of his personality.  He portrays Nijinsky as a deeply complex individual: fiercely independent, yet profoundly insecure; possessing an unparalleled artistic talent, yet plagued by crippling self-doubt; a revolutionary who shattered conventions, yet profoundly vulnerable to the pressures of his own genius and the tumultuous circumstances of his life.  His intense devotion to his art, his unwavering commitment to pushing creative boundaries, and his ultimately tragic downfall all contribute to the captivating narrative that Buckle unfolds.

The lasting influence of Nijinsky on the world of dance is undeniable.  His revolutionary approach to choreography, his unique style of movement, and his ability to express profound emotion through dance continue to inspire dancers and choreographers today.  His legacy is not solely confined to the realm of ballet; his artistic innovations and personal struggles have made him a subject of fascination for artists, writers, and historians across various disciplines.

In conclusion, Richard Buckle’s "Nijinsky" is far more than a simple biography; it is a compelling exploration of a complex artistic genius whose life was both exhilarating and heartbreaking.  The book masterfully weaves together details of Nijinsky's life, his extraordinary career, his turbulent relationships, and his tragic descent into mental illness, presenting a comprehensive and deeply insightful portrait of a man whose influence continues to resonate in the world of dance and beyond. Buckle's meticulous research and engaging writing style create a compelling narrative that captures the essence of Nijinsky's captivating personality, his groundbreaking achievements, and his lasting legacy as one of the most significant figures in the history of dance.
