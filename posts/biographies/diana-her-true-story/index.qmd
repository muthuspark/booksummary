Andrew Morton's "Diana: Her True Story," published in 1992, remains a controversial yet influential biography of Diana, Princess of Wales.  It offered a candid and, at the time, unprecedented glimpse into the private life of a member of the British Royal Family, shattering the carefully constructed image of regal perfection and revealing a woman grappling with immense pressure, emotional turmoil, and a profound sense of isolation. While the book’s accuracy has been debated, its impact on public perception of the monarchy and Diana herself was undeniable.  This summary will explore Diana's life as portrayed by Morton, focusing on her personal journey, key relationships, and lasting legacy.

**Early Life and Family Dynamics:**  Morton paints a picture of a childhood marked by both privilege and instability. Diana Frances Spencer was born into aristocratic lineage, but her family life was far from idyllic. Her parents' tumultuous marriage, marked by infidelity and eventual divorce, left a lasting emotional scar.  The book details a childhood that, despite outward appearances, was characterized by a lack of parental affection and a feeling of being overlooked and undervalued. This early sense of insecurity, according to Morton, deeply influenced Diana's future relationships and her vulnerability to manipulation.  Her education was unremarkable, and the book highlights the lack of intellectual stimulation she experienced, contrasting with the expectations and pressures of her future royal role.

**Marriage to Prince Charles and the Rise to Public Affection:**  Diana's marriage to Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, was portrayed by Morton as a fairytale façade masking a deeply unhappy reality.  The book suggests the marriage was far from a love match, highlighting Charles's continued relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.  Diana's struggle to navigate the complexities of royal life, coupled with her perceived inadequacy in the eyes of the royal establishment and her husband's coldness, are central themes.  The book meticulously details the pressures of royal protocol, the isolation within the royal family, and the emotional toll it took on Diana.  However, it also depicts Diana's gradual emergence as a powerful and charismatic figure, earning the affection of the public through her charitable work, her approachable demeanor, and her genuine empathy for the less fortunate.  Morton highlights her groundbreaking work with AIDS patients, challenging the stigma surrounding the disease, and her commitment to various charities focusing on the vulnerable and marginalized.  These acts of compassion resonated deeply with the British public, solidifying her image as the "People's Princess."

**Bulimia, Emotional Distress, and the Breakdown of the Marriage:**  A crucial element of Morton's biography is the exploration of Diana's struggle with bulimia nervosa. The book portrays this as a symptom of her deep-seated unhappiness, her feelings of inadequacy, and the immense pressure she felt within the confines of royal life. The detailed account, while potentially controversial in its intimacy, underscores the immense emotional toll of her marriage and the lack of support she received within the royal family. The book also sheds light on the growing rift between Diana and Charles, the infidelity on both sides, and the increasingly strained relations within the royal household.  The breakdown of the marriage is portrayed not just as a personal tragedy but as a clash between Diana's desire for genuine connection and the rigid structures and expectations of the British monarchy.

**The Media's Role and Public Image:** Morton's book also explores the symbiotic relationship between Diana and the media. Initially, the media perpetuated the fairytale image of the royal marriage, but as the cracks began to show, it became increasingly interested in the personal struggles of the princess.  The book details how Diana, initially a reluctant participant in the media circus, gradually learned to utilize it to her advantage, crafting her public image and sharing her side of the story. This strategic use of media attention contributed significantly to her growing popularity and the public's sympathy towards her plight.  However, the book also highlights the negative aspects of media intrusion, the relentless pursuit of personal information, and the damaging effect this had on Diana's mental health.  The book implicitly criticizes the intrusive nature of the media and the royal family’s handling of the situation.

**Diana's Post-Divorce Life and Continued Charity Work:**  Following the divorce from Prince Charles, Diana continued her charitable work with renewed vigor and independence.  The book chronicles her efforts to break free from the constraints of royal protocol and to use her platform to advocate for humanitarian causes.  It highlights her commitment to banning landmines, her work with cancer charities, and her ongoing efforts to improve the lives of the marginalized.  The book shows Diana leveraging her newfound freedom to become a more outspoken and influential humanitarian figure, independent of royal constraints.  She used her position to raise awareness on issues that were previously largely ignored, challenging established power structures and influencing global perspectives.

**Death and Legacy:**  The premature death of Diana in a car crash in Paris in 1997 is presented as a tragic culmination of the pressures and challenges she faced throughout her life. The book, written before her death, foreshadows the potential for tragedy. While not predicting the manner of her death, it lays the groundwork for understanding the fragility of her emotional state and the relentless pressures she endured. Diana's death profoundly impacted the British public, sparking an outpouring of grief and anger. The subsequent outpouring of public emotion led to a significant reevaluation of the monarchy's relationship with the public and a renewed focus on its relevance in modern Britain.  Diana’s legacy extends beyond her personal life and transcends the confines of royal history. She is remembered not only as a style icon but as a humanitarian champion who broke through the barriers of protocol and used her influence to improve the lives of others, leaving a lasting mark on the world stage.

**Controversies and Criticisms:**  "Diana: Her True Story" has faced criticism regarding its accuracy and the methods employed by Morton to obtain information.  The book relied heavily on anonymous sources and tapes secretly recorded by Diana's staff, raising questions about its objectivity and the potential for bias and manipulation.  The book's intimate details about Diana's personal life, particularly her struggles with bulimia and her marital problems, were seen by some as a betrayal of her privacy, even though Diana implicitly authorized the sharing of her story.  Despite these criticisms, the book remains a significant contribution to the understanding of Diana's life and its lasting impact.  It sparked a crucial conversation about the role of the monarchy in a changing world, the pressures placed on individuals within the royal family, and the importance of addressing mental health and societal inequalities.

In conclusion, "Diana: Her True Story" offers a compelling, albeit controversial, narrative of Diana's life.  It moves beyond the superficial image of a princess to portray a complex woman wrestling with personal insecurities, societal pressures, and the constraints of royal life. While its accuracy remains debated, its impact on public perception is undeniable. The book helped shape the image of Diana as the "People's Princess," highlighting her compassion, her struggle against adversity, and her lasting contribution to humanitarian causes.  It also sparked broader societal discussions regarding the media’s role, the monarchy’s place in a modern world, and the challenges faced by individuals living under intense public scrutiny. The book's lasting significance lies not just in the details of Diana's life, but in its power to challenge assumptions, provoke debate, and generate enduring interest in the life and legacy of a woman who captivated the world.
