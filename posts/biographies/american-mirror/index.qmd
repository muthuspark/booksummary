Deborah Solomon's "American Mirror: Reflections on the Photography of Edward Steichen" is not a straightforward biography in the traditional sense.  Instead, it's a deeply insightful examination of Edward Steichen's life and work through the lens of his own words and images, supplemented by Solomon's meticulous research and insightful analysis.  Therefore, a summary focusing on key aspects of Steichen's life requires extracting those elements interwoven throughout the book's thematic structure.  The book doesn't chronologically unfold Steichen's life, but rather explores recurring themes in his photography, reflecting his evolving personality and artistic vision.  This summary will organize the elements of his life into a more conventional biographical structure while acknowledging the thematic approach of Solomon's work.


**Early Life and Artistic Awakening (Luxembourg to New York):**  Born in Luxembourg in 1879, Edward Steichen's early years were marked by poverty and a yearning for self-expression.  Solomon highlights the influence of his artistic mother, who encouraged his creative talents, even in the face of his father's disapproval of artistic pursuits.  Steichen's early artistic inclinations manifested in painting before he discovered photography.  His self-taught approach to photography, marked by experimentation and a keen eye for visual aesthetics, quickly propelled him beyond mere documentation. The family’s emigration to the United States in 1881 provided a crucial backdrop for Steichen's development.  New York City, with its burgeoning artistic scene, became a crucible for his burgeoning talent.  His early work, often reflecting a Symbolist and Pictorialist style, showcased his innate ability to manipulate the photographic medium to create evocative and emotionally resonant images. The book underlines Steichen’s rebellious nature, reflected in his frequent clashes with authority and his continuous search for new artistic expression.


**The Pictorialist and Modernist Phases:** Solomon meticulously traces Steichen's journey through the Pictorialist movement, where he embraced soft-focus techniques and artistic manipulations to imbue his photographs with a painterly quality. This period is characterized by his pursuit of beauty and subjective expression, showcasing his artistic skill and innovation within the confines of a then-nascent art form.  His early success and growing reputation in both Europe and America are detailed, highlighting his entrepreneurial spirit and understanding of the evolving art market. However, Solomon also reveals his subsequent dissatisfaction with the limitations of Pictorialism, leading him to embrace a more modernist approach – a radical shift away from the softness and romanticization of the earlier style.  This transition reveals his restless artistic temperament and constant desire for innovation.  This change is mirrored in his increasingly direct and less manipulated approach to photography, reflecting a shift in societal aesthetics.


**War Photography and the Development of a Modern Vision:**  Steichen's experience during World War I significantly shaped his artistic perspective.  His role as an official photographer for the US Army allowed him to document the realities of war, leading him to adopt a more objective and documentary style.  Solomon explores this pivotal moment, highlighting his shift towards clarity and directness in his imagery.  He moved away from the soft romanticism of his Pictorialist phase, acknowledging the harsh realities of war and human experience. The stark contrast between his early work and his war photographs underlines his adaptability and willingness to evolve as an artist to reflect changing social and political realities.  This evolution is pivotal in understanding his future contributions to the broader photographic landscape.


**Commercial Success and Artistic Influence:** Steichen's talent extended beyond fine art photography.  He ventured into commercial photography, including advertising and fashion, with remarkable success.  Solomon expertly navigates his professional achievements and reveals how this commercial work didn't compromise his artistic vision. In fact, his commercial projects sometimes served as a testing ground for his technical skills and experimentation with light and composition, which subsequently enriched his artistic work.  The book emphasizes his entrepreneurial skills and his ability to navigate the complex world of the art market.  His significant contributions to the development of modern advertising photography show his versatility and impact across various facets of visual culture.


**The Museum of Modern Art and the Family of Man:**  Perhaps Steichen's most lasting contribution lies in his curatorial work.  His involvement with the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), first as an artist and later as its director of photography, established his influence on the institution and its development.  Solomon delves into his role in shaping MoMA’s photographic collection and its overall aesthetic vision.  The book dedicates considerable space to "The Family of Man," his groundbreaking 1955 exhibition showcasing the universality of human experience through photography. While celebrated as a powerful message of human unity, this exhibition also stirred controversy, with criticisms leveled at its romanticized vision and its potential for overlooking cultural nuances. Solomon's analysis helps to understand the complexities of the exhibition's legacy, highlighting its enduring influence even amidst critical debate.


**Personal Life and Relationships:** Solomon doesn't shy away from portraying the complexities of Steichen's personal life.  His relationships, often turbulent and passionate, are explored without judgment.  His marriages, his numerous affairs, and his complex personal dynamics are woven into the narrative, enriching the understanding of the man behind the lens.  This isn't just a biography of an artist; it’s a portrait of a complex and multifaceted individual whose life was as dramatic and dynamic as his work. The book portrays his personal struggles, his emotional vulnerabilities, and his search for meaning, showing how these aspects shaped his art and its reception.


**Challenges and Controversies:**  Steichen's life wasn't without its controversies.  The book touches upon criticisms of his commercial work, accusations of self-promotion, and the inherent biases present in "The Family of Man."  Solomon's analysis acknowledges these controversies without minimizing his achievements.  Steichen's outspoken nature and his unwavering belief in his artistic vision sometimes led to conflicts and disagreements, all of which are sensitively presented in the book.  The inclusion of these criticisms provides a balanced perspective, allowing readers to form their own conclusions about his legacy.


**Legacy and Lasting Influence:**  Edward Steichen's lasting impact on photography is undeniable.  His contributions as an artist, curator, and educator shaped the development of modern photography and its acceptance as a fine art.  He played a significant role in establishing photography's place within the broader art world.  "American Mirror" effectively summarizes this legacy, highlighting his pioneering work, his bold experimentation, and his ability to adapt and evolve throughout his prolific career.  His influence extends beyond the purely artistic; he impacted the realm of advertising and commercial photography, demonstrating the profound influence of art on everyday life and the ways we perceive the world.   Solomon's book ultimately presents Steichen not only as a master photographer but also as a pivotal figure who helped shape the very understanding and perception of photography as we know it today.  Through a combination of his photographic work, his curatorial choices, and his interactions with the art world, he cemented his place in history as one of the most significant figures in 20th-century photography. The book encourages readers to reflect on Steichen’s legacy and to consider the lasting implications of his work, its successes and its perceived shortcomings, in shaping our visual culture and our understanding of the art form itself.
