# The Core Principle: Thinking in a Certain Way

Wallace D. Wattles's "The Science of Getting Rich" isn't about quick schemes or get-rich-quick strategies.  Instead, it centers on a fundamental principle:  achieving wealth requires a specific way of thinking, a conscious and deliberate alignment of your mind with the universal laws of prosperity.  This isn't about manipulating others; it's about aligning yourself with the creative force of the universe.  The book emphasizes that wealth is your birthright, readily available to those who understand and apply its principles.

# The Importance of a Definite Purpose

The first critical step is formulating a definite purpose. This isn't just a vague desire; it's a clearly defined plan, complete with a specific amount of wealth you aim to acquire and a precise timeline. This clarity provides a target for your subconscious mind to work towards.  Vague goals yield vague results.

#  The Power of Faith and Belief

Faith, according to Wattles, is not blind belief; it’s a firm conviction that your definite purpose is attainable.  This belief must be unshakeable, operating on the principle that you are deserving of wealth and that the universe will support your endeavors.  Doubt is the primary enemy of success in this system.


#  The Role of Gratitude and Positive Thinking

Cultivating gratitude is essential.  Focusing on what you already have, rather than what you lack, creates a positive mental environment, attracting more abundance.  This positive thinking extends to all aspects of your life; negativity hinders the process of attracting wealth.

#  The Power of Autosuggestion

Wattles advocates for the use of autosuggestion – the repetition of affirmative statements to program your subconscious mind.  Regularly repeating affirmations related to your definite purpose reinforces your belief and prepares your mind for success.  This constant reinforcement strengthens your faith and pushes you towards action.


#  The Importance of Action:  The Law of Action

Faith without action is futile.  While positive thinking and belief are crucial, they must be complemented by consistent, focused action toward your goal. This action should be guided by your definite purpose and informed by your growing belief in your ability to achieve it.


#  The Principle of Giving and Receiving:  A Necessary Exchange

While the book primarily focuses on personal wealth, it stresses the importance of giving. This isn't merely charitable giving, but a principle of exchange.  By offering value to others, you create opportunities for yourself to receive abundance.  This cyclical exchange reinforces the flow of wealth in your life.

#  The Importance of Accurate Thinking

Wattles highlights the need for accurate thinking, free from self-limiting beliefs and negative thought patterns.  Accurate thinking is the ability to perceive the opportunities available to you and to understand that wealth is already present in the universe, ready to be utilized. This entails overcoming any mental blocks or limiting beliefs that prevent you from receiving it.


#  Visualizing Success:  The Power of Mental Imagery

Visualizing the achievement of your definite purpose plays a crucial role in manifesting it into reality.  Regularly picturing yourself already possessing the wealth you desire programs your subconscious mind and prepares you for the success that’s to come.  It's about creating a mental blueprint of your desired reality.


#  The Significance of Persistence and Patience

The path to achieving wealth, according to Wattles, is not always easy or instantaneous.  Persistence is paramount.  Setbacks and challenges are inevitable, but perseverance through these obstacles is vital for ultimate success.  Patience is key as well – the process of manifestation takes time.

#  The Necessity of Accurate Thinking:  Avoiding the Trap of Negativity

Negative thoughts, feelings of inadequacy, doubt, and fear are major obstacles to achieving wealth.  Wattles strongly advises against engaging in envy, jealousy, or resentment; these emotions disrupt the positive mental state required for attracting wealth.


#  Overcoming Limiting Beliefs and Self-Doubt

Self-doubt and limiting beliefs are deeply ingrained and can severely hinder the process.  Wattles emphasizes the importance of identifying and challenging these beliefs. He suggests replacing negative self-talk with positive affirmations and focusing on your strengths.


#  Harnessing the Power of Your Subconscious Mind

Your subconscious mind is a powerful tool, capable of attracting what you believe to be true.  Wattles encourages the reader to cultivate a positive, abundant mindset that programs the subconscious to work towards wealth.  Your conscious intentions must be mirrored by your subconscious beliefs.


#  Avoiding the Traps of Competition and Envy

Wattles cautions against competition. The process is not about outperforming others but about aligning yourself with the universal principles of prosperity.  He stresses the importance of focusing on your own goals rather than on what others have achieved. Envy and competition are seen as detrimental.


#  Understanding the Nature of Wealth

Wattles argues that wealth is not solely material possessions but also includes health, happiness, and strong relationships. It’s about overall well-being and a sense of abundance in all aspects of life.


#  The Importance of Service and Value Creation

The book subtly emphasizes the importance of creating value for others. Wealth is not about accumulating riches for oneself but also about contributing positively to society. Serving others and adding value to their lives is an integral part of the process.
