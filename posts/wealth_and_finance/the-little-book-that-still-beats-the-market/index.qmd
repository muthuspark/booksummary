Joel Greenblatt's "The Little Book That Still Beats the Market" offers a straightforward, actionable approach to value investing, empowering readers to achieve superior returns by focusing on undervalued companies with strong financial characteristics.  The book distills complex investment strategies into a simple, repeatable process, accessible to both novice and experienced investors.  Instead of relying on market timing or complex predictions, it emphasizes identifying fundamentally sound businesses trading below their intrinsic value.

The core of Greenblatt's strategy rests on two key metrics: **Return on Capital (ROC)** and **Earnings Yield (EBIT/EV)**.  He argues that high ROC indicates a company's ability to generate profits from its invested capital, signifying management efficiency and sustainable competitive advantage.  Earnings yield, representing the earnings generated relative to the company's enterprise value, reflects the return an investor receives for each dollar invested.  By combining these two, Greenblatt creates a ranked list of companies offering potentially high returns.

**Key Advice and Strategies:**

1. **Focus on High Return on Capital (ROC):** Greenblatt emphasizes the importance of identifying companies with consistently high ROC. This metric signifies a company's ability to generate substantial profits from its invested capital, indicative of a strong business model and efficient management. He suggests looking for companies with ROC consistently above 15% over a period of several years.  High ROC signals a "magic" business capable of generating high returns.  This isn't about short-term gains but sustained profitability, representing a core competency less susceptible to market fluctuations.

2. **Favor High Earnings Yield (EBIT/EV):**  Earnings Yield (EBIT/Enterprise Value) is the second crucial metric.  It represents the earnings generated by a company relative to its total enterprise value (market cap + debt - cash). A higher earnings yield suggests the market is undervaluing the company's earning power, offering investors a potentially higher return for their investment.  Greenblatt advocates for selecting companies with earnings yields significantly higher than the average.  This captures the "cheapness" aspect of value investing, seeking opportunities where the market price fails to reflect the company's inherent value.

3. **Combine ROC and Earnings Yield:** The magic of Greenblatt's approach lies in combining these two metrics. He suggests constructing a ranked list of companies based on the combined score of ROC and Earnings Yield.  This isn't a simple average, but a more sophisticated ranking system that prioritizes companies exhibiting high scores in both categories. By prioritizing companies with a high combined score, investors can find businesses with both strong operational performance (high ROC) and attractive valuation (high Earnings Yield). This strategy aims to capture companies demonstrating both quality and value.

4. **Invest in a diversified portfolio:**  Greenblatt advocates for diversification to mitigate risk.  He recommends investing in 20-30 companies, distributing investments across various sectors and industries. This mitigates the risk associated with relying on a small number of investments and reduces the impact of individual company performance on the overall portfolio performance.  Diversification spreads risk across multiple opportunities, lowering the impact of any single underperforming investment.

5. **Rebalance periodically:** Greenblatt recommends rebalancing the portfolio annually. Rebalancing involves selling some of the best-performing investments and reinvesting the proceeds in the lower-performing ones.  This strategy helps maintain a consistent allocation across the portfolio, ensuring that no single position becomes overweight.  The idea is to lock in gains from winners while reinvesting in potentially undervalued companies, maintaining portfolio balance and exploiting market inefficiencies.

6. **Focus on the long term:** Value investing isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. Greenblatt highlights the importance of a long-term perspective.  Investors should hold their investments for a considerable period, allowing time for the market to recognize the undervalued companies' true worth.  The strategy prioritizes long-term compounding, acknowledging that markets can be inefficient and undervaluing fundamentally strong businesses for extended periods.

7. **Don't try to time the market:**  Greenblatt strongly discourages market timing.  His strategy focuses on finding undervalued companies and holding them for the long term, regardless of short-term market fluctuations. This minimizes the emotional aspect of investing, preventing impulsive decisions driven by market sentiment.  The focus is on the underlying business fundamentals, not trying to predict short-term market trends.


**Actionable Insights:**

* **Screen for companies:** Utilize financial screening tools available online or through your brokerage to identify companies with high ROC and Earnings Yield.
* **Analyze financial statements:** Learn to interpret key financial statements like the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement to evaluate a company's financial health and profitability.
* **Understand business models:**  Before investing, understand the business model of the company and its competitive advantage.
* **Use a spreadsheet:**  Create a spreadsheet to track your investments, calculate key metrics, and monitor your portfolio's performance.
* **Be patient and disciplined:**  Value investing requires patience and discipline. Don't panic sell during market downturns and stick to your investment strategy.
